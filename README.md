# StatiCrypt

Based on the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API), StatiCrypt uses AES-GCM to encrypt your string with your passphrase in your browser (client side).

This means you can password protect the content of your static HTML file while still having the whole file completely public, without any back-end - serving it over Netlify, GitHub pages, etc.

You can encrypt a file online in your browser (client side) at https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt, or use the CLI to do it in your build process.

## HOW IT WORKS

StatiCrypt use the [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) library to generate a static, password protected page that can be decrypted in-browser: just send or upload the generated page to a place serving static content (github pages, for example) and you're done: the javascript will prompt users for password, decrypt the page and load your HTML.

It basically encrypts your page and puts everything with a user-friendly way to use a password in the new file.

AES-GCM is state of the art but brute-force/dictionary attacks would be trivial to do at a really fast pace: **use a long, unusual passphrase**.

**Disclaimer:** The concept is simple and should work ok but I am not a cryptographer, if you have sensitive banking or crypto data you might want to use something else. :)

You can report thoughts and issues to the [GitHub project](https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt) but be warned I might be extremely slow to respond (though the community might help). If a serious security issue is reported I'll try to fix it quickly.

## CLI

Staticrypt is available through npm as a CLI, install with `npm install -g staticrypt` (with or without the `-g` flag). If without the `-g` flag, you can call the command with `npx staticrypt ...`.

### Example usage

> These will create a `.staticrypt.json` file in the current directory, see the FAQ as to why. You can prevent it by setting the `--config` flag to "false".

Encrypt `test.html` and create a `test_encrypted.html` file (add `-o my_encrypted_file.html` to change the name of the output file):

```
staticrypt test.html MY_PASSPHRASE
```

Encrypt all html files in a directory and replace them with encrypted versions (`{}` will be replaced with each file name by the `find` command - if you wanted to move the encrypted files to a `encrypted/` directory, you could use `-o encrypted/{}`):

```
find . -type f -name "*.html" -exec staticrypt {} MY_PASSPHRASE -o {} \;
```

Encrypt all html files in a directory except the ones ending in `_encrypted.html`:

```
find . -type f -name "*.html" -not -name "*_encrypted.html" -exec staticrypt {} MY_PASSPHRASE \;
```

### "Remember me" checkbox

The CLI will add a "Remember me" checkbox on the password prompt by default (`--noremember` to disable). If the user checks it, the (salted + hashed) passphrase will be stored in their browser's localStorage and the page will attempt to auto-decrypt when they come back.

If no value is provided the stored passphrase doesn't expire, you can also give it a value in days for how long should the store value be kept with `-r NUMBER_OF_DAYS`. If the user reconnects to the page after the expiration date the stored value will be cleared.

#### "Logging out"

You can clear StatiCrypt values in localStorage (effectively "logging out") at any time by appending `staticrypt_logout` to the URL query parameters (`mysite.com?staticrypt_logout`).

#### Encrypting multiple pages

This allows encrypting multiple page on a single domain with the same password: if you check "Remember me", you'll have to enter you password once then all the pages on that domain will automatically decrypt their content. Because the hashed value is stored in the browser's localStorage, this will only work if all the pages are on the same domain name.

#### Is it secure?

In case the value stored in browser becomes compromised an attacker can decrypt the page, but because it's stored salted and hashed this should still protect against password reuse attack if you've used the passphrase on other websites (of course, please use a unique passphrase nonetheless).

## FAQ

### Can I customize the password prompt?

Yes! Just copy `cli/password_template.html`, modify it to suit your style and point to your template file with the `-f path/to/my/file.html` flag. Be careful to not break the encrypting javascript part, the variables replaced by StatiCrypt are between curly brackets: `{salt}`.

### Can I prevent the "Remember me" checkbox?

If you don't want the checkbox to be included, you can add the `--noremember` flag to disable it.

### Why does StatiCrypt create a config file?

The "Remember me" feature stores the user password hashed and salted in the browser's localStorage, so it needs the salt to be the same each time you encrypt otherwise the user would be logged out when you encrypt the page again. The config file is a way to store the salt in between runs, so you don't have to remember it and pass it manually.

When deciding what salt to use, StatiCrypt will first look for a `--salt` flag, then try to get the salt from the config file, and if it still doesn't find a salt it will generate a random one. It then saves the salt in the config file.

If you don't want StatiCrypt to create or use the config file, you can set `--config false` to disable it.

The salt isn't secret, so you don't need to worry about hiding the config file.

## üôè Contribution

Thank you: [@AaronCoplan](https://github.com/AaronCoplan) for bringing the CLI to life, [@epicfaace](https://github.com/epicfaace) & [@thomasmarr](https://github.com/thomasmarr) for sparking the caching of the passphrase in localStorage (allowing the "Remember me" checkbox)

**Opening PRs:** You're free to open PRs if you're ok with having no response for a (possibly very) long time and me possibly ending up getting inspiration from your proposal but merging something different myself (I'll try to credit you though). Apologies in advance for the delay, and thank you!

If you find a serious security bug please open an issue, I'll try to fix it relatively quickly.

## Alternatives

https://github.com/MaxLaumeister/PageCrypt is a similar project (I think it predates StatiCrypt).

https://github.com/tarpdalton/staticrypt/tree/webcrypto is a fork that uses the WebCrypto browser api to encrypt and decrypt the page, which removes the need for `crypto-js`. There's a PR open towards here which I haven't checked in detail yet. WebCrypto is only available in HTTPS context (which [is annoying people](https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto/issues/28)) so it won't work if you're on HTTP.
